# cifar-100 conv net with Caffe for DVIA

Based on guillaume-chevalier's implementation of NiN for Cifar-100 imageset. This is a variation of the same database scaled _up_ to 48x48 (DVIA images at 48x48 full resolution).

It is based on the NIN (Network In Network) architecture detailed in this paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4400v3.pdf. 

https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/python-caffe-custom-cifar-100-conv-net for original implementation.

## Convert the cifar-100 dataset to Caffe's HDF5 format
This step converts previously downloaded Cifar-100 database to 48x48 HDF5 DB.


```python
%%time

!ipython convert-cifar-100.ipy
```

    Converting...
    Conversion was already done. Did not convert twice.
    
    CPU times: user 16 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 20 ms
    Wall time: 1.61 s


## Build the model with Caffe. 


```python
import numpy as np

## Pre-Train Using Cifar-100 DB (scaled to 48x48)
The purpose of this pre-training part is to take advantage of the Cifar-100 database to get better feature extractor as a initial condition for later training with our own image database.

## Load and visualise the untrained network's internal structure and shape
The network's structure (graph) visualisation tool of caffe is broken in the current release. We will simply print here the data shapes. 


```python

# tstnet = caffe.Net('dvia_pretest.prototxt', caffe.TEST)
# tstnets = [ tstnet ]
# solver = caffe.RMSPropSolver('dvia_presolver.prototxt')
# solver.train_net = trnet
# solver.test_nets[0] = tstnets[0]

solver = caffe.RMSPropSolver('dvia_solver.prototxt')
#solver = caffe.get_solver('dvia_solver.prototxt')
print("\nLayers' features:")

      ('fc_class', (4, 600))]


## Solver's params

The solver's params for the created net are defined in a `.prototxt` file. 

Notice that because `max_iter: 100000`, the training will loop 2 times on the 50000 training data. Because we train data by minibatches of 100 as defined above when creating the net, there will be a total of `100000*100/50000 = 200` epochs on some of those pre-shuffled 100 images minibatches.

We will test the net on `test_iter: 100` different test images at each `test_interval: 1000` images trained. 
____

Here, **RMSProp** is used, it is SDG-based, it converges faster than a pure SGD and it is robust.

## Alternative way to train directly in Python
Since a recent update, there is no output in python by default, which is bad for debugging. 
Skip this cell and train with the second method shown below if needed. It is commented out in case you just chain some `shift+enter` ipython shortcuts. 


```python
# %%time
# solver.solve()
solver = None
```

## Train by calling caffe in command line
Just set the parameters correctly. Be sure that the notebook is at the root of the ipython notebook server. 
You can run this in an external terminal if you open it in the notebook's directory. 

It is also possible to finetune an existing net with a different solver or different data. Here I do it, because I feel the net could better fit the data. 


```python
%%time
!caffe train -solver dvia_solver.prototxt -weights cifar_pretrained.caffemodel
```
